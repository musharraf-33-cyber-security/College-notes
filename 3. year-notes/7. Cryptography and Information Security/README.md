### Security Concepts
1. **What is the importance of security in information systems, and what are the potential consequences of security breaches?**
   
2. **Explain the key principles of security (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) and how they relate to overall security strategies.**

3. **Identify and describe different types of security attacks (e.g., denial-of-service, phishing, malware) and the potential impact of each.**

4. **What are the various security services (e.g., authentication, access control, non-repudiation) and how do they contribute to a secure environment?**

5. **Discuss different security mechanisms used to protect data and networks, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption.**

6. **Describe a model for network security and how it addresses various security challenges.**

### Cryptography Concepts and Techniques
1. **Define plain text and cipher text. How do these concepts relate to encryption and decryption?**

2. **Differentiate between substitution and transposition techniques in cryptography. Provide examples of each.**

3. **What are the differences between symmetric key cryptography and asymmetric key cryptography? Discuss their advantages and disadvantages.**

4. **Explain the concept of steganography and how it differs from cryptography.**

5. **Discuss the significance of key range and key size in cryptographic systems. How do they affect security?**

6. **What are the possible types of attacks on cryptographic systems (e.g., brute force, man-in-the-middle, replay attacks)?**

### Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
1. **Explain the Diffie-Hellman key exchange process and its importance in secure communications.**

2. **Describe the principles behind block ciphers and how they differ from stream ciphers.**

3. **Compare and contrast DES, AES, RSA, and Triple DES in terms of their algorithms, key lengths, and security strength.**

4. **What are the main vulnerabilities associated with the DES encryption algorithm, and how did AES address these issues?**

5. **How does the RSA algorithm utilize both encryption and digital signatures, and what are its practical applications?**
