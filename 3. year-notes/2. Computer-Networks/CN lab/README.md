 
### Experiment 1: Study of Different Types of LAN and Network Equipment

#### Aim:
To study different types of Local Area Networks (LAN) and various network equipment.

#### Apparatus Required:
- RJ-45 connectors
- Clamping tool
- Twisted pair cables
- Network devices (Repeater, Hub, Switch, Bridge, Router, Gateway)

#### Theory:
1. **LAN Types**:
   - **Ethernet LAN**: Uses Ethernet cables and switches to connect devices.
   - **Wireless LAN (WLAN)**: Uses wireless signals (Wi-Fi) to connect devices.
   - **Virtual LAN (VLAN)**: Segments a physical network into multiple logical networks.

2. **Network Equipment**:
   - **Repeater**: Amplifies the signal to extend the distance it can travel.
   - **Hub**: Connects multiple Ethernet devices, making them act as a single network segment.
   - **Switch**: Connects devices and filters data packets, sending them to the correct destination.
   - **Bridge**: Connects two or more network segments, filtering traffic at the data link layer.
   - **Router**: Routes data packets between different networks, operating at the network layer.
   - **Gateway**: Connects networks using different protocols, translating data between them.

#### Procedure:
1. **Study of Network Cables**:
   - **Cross-wired Cable**: Used to connect two similar devices (e.g., two computers).
   - **Straight-through Cable**: Used to connect different devices (e.g., a computer to a switch).

2. **Implementation**:
   - Strip about 2 inches of the plastic jacket off the end of the cable.
   - Arrange the wires according to the type of cable (cross-wired or straight-through).
   - Use the clamping tool to attach the RJ-45 connectors.
