**6. CIS Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense:**

- **What are the CIS Critical Security Controls, and why are they considered best practices for cybersecurity?**
  - The CIS Critical Security Controls are a set of prioritized actions and best practices that help organizations defend against cyber threats. They focus on fundamental security measures like inventory of assets, secure configuration, and access control, which reduce the risk of attacks.

- **Describe the Top 5 CIS Controls and their relevance to cyber defense.**
  1. **Inventory and Control of Hardware Assets:** Helps track and manage all devices connected to the network.
  2. **Inventory and Control of Software Assets:** Ensures only authorized software is installed, reducing vulnerability to malicious software.
  3. **Continuous Vulnerability Management:** Involves scanning and patching vulnerabilities regularly to prevent exploitation.
  4. **Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges:** Limits and monitors privileged access to reduce misuse of sensitive systems.
  5. **Secure Configuration for Hardware and Software:** Ensures systems are configured securely to prevent attacks on default settings.

- **How can the CIS Controls be mapped to different cybersecurity frameworks?**
  - The CIS Controls can be mapped to frameworks like NIST CSF, ISO/IEC 27001, and PCI DSS, as they provide similar guidelines for securing information systems and data.
