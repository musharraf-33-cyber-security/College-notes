## Introduction
This README provides an overview of file systems and their implementation. It covers various components and concepts essential for understanding how file systems operate and manage data on storage devices.

## File System Interface
The file system interface defines how applications interact with the file system. It includes system calls for creating, reading, writing, and deleting files, as well as managing directories and permissions.

## File Concepts
Files are collections of data stored on a storage medium. Key concepts include:
- **File Types**: Different formats (e.g., text, binary, executable).
- **File Attributes**: Metadata associated with files (e.g., size, creation date).
- **File Structure**: Organization of data within a file (e.g., sequential, random access).

## Access Methods
Access methods define how data in files can be accessed. Common methods include:
- **Sequential Access**: Reading data in a linear order.
- **Random Access**: Accessing data at any location within the file.

## Directory Structure
The directory structure organizes files in a hierarchical manner. Common structures include:
- **Single-level Directory**: All files are stored in one directory.
- **Two-level Directory**: Separate directories for users, with user-specific files.
- **Hierarchical Directory**: A tree-like structure allowing for nested directories.

## File System Mounting
Mounting refers to making a file system accessible at a particular point in the directory structure. This process involves:
- **Mount Points**: Directories where file systems are attached.
- **Mounting Procedures**: The steps to integrate a file system into the existing directory structure.

## Directory Implementation
Directories can be implemented using various structures, such as:
- **Linked Lists**: Each directory entry points to the next.
- **Hash Tables**: Provides fast access through hashing.
- **Arrays**: Simple but may require resizing as entries grow.

## Allocation Methods
File storage allocation methods determine how files occupy space on the disk. Common methods include:
- **Contiguous Allocation**: Files are stored in contiguous blocks.
- **Linked Allocation**: Files are stored in scattered blocks linked together.
- **Indexed Allocation**: An index block holds pointers to the file's data blocks.

## Free Space Management
Efficient free space management is crucial for performance. Methods include:
- **Bitmaps**: A bitmap represents free and occupied blocks.
- **Free Lists**: A linked list of free blocks.
- **Grouping**: Keeping track of free block groups for faster allocation.

## Recovery
Recovery techniques help restore data after failures. Strategies include:
- **Backup Systems**: Regular snapshots of file systems.
- **Journaling**: Recording changes before they are committed to ensure consistency.

## Log-Structured File Systems
Log-structured file systems optimize write operations by treating the disk as a circular log. Key benefits include:
- Improved write performance.
- Simplified recovery through the log structure.
- Efficient space management by periodically cleaning up old entries.
