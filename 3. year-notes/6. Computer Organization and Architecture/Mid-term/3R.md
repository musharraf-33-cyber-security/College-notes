### 1. What are instruction codes in computer architecture?
**Answer:** Instruction codes are binary representations of commands that the processor understands and executes. Each code corresponds to a specific operation, such as arithmetic, logic, or data movement.

### 2. What are computer registers, and what is their purpose?
**Answer:** Computer registers are small, fast storage locations within the CPU that hold data temporarily during processing. They are used for operations like holding operands for arithmetic operations or storing memory addresses.

### 3. What are the main types of computer instructions?
**Answer:** The main types of computer instructions include:
- **Data movement instructions** (e.g., loading data from memory),
- **Arithmetic instructions** (e.g., addition, subtraction),
- **Logic instructions** (e.g., AND, OR),
- **Control instructions** (e.g., jumps, branches).

### 4. What is the instruction cycle?
**Answer:** The instruction cycle is the process by which a CPU fetches, decodes, and executes an instruction. It typically consists of three main phases: fetch, decode, and execute.

### 5. What are register-reference and memory-reference instructions?
**Answer:**
- **Register-reference instructions** operate on data in registers and include operations like incrementing a register.
- **Memory-reference instructions** involve accessing data from memory, such as loading data from memory into a register or storing data from a register back into memory.

### 6. How do input-output operations work in a computer system?
**Answer:** Input-output operations enable the CPU to communicate with external devices. This can involve reading data from input devices (like keyboards) or writing data to output devices (like monitors) through specific I/O instructions.

### 7. What is an interrupt in computer architecture?
**Answer:** An interrupt is a signal that temporarily halts the CPU's current operations, allowing it to address an event that requires immediate attention (e.g., input from a user or a hardware failure). After servicing the interrupt, the CPU resumes its previous task.

### 8. Describe the design of a basic computer.
**Answer:** The design of a basic computer typically includes:
- A CPU that executes instructions,
- Memory for storing data and instructions,
- I/O interfaces for external communication,
- A control unit to manage instruction execution,
- An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) for performing calculations.

### 9. What role does the control unit play in a computer?
**Answer:** The control unit directs the operation of the processor. It interprets instruction codes and generates control signals to coordinate the actions of the CPU's components, ensuring instructions are executed in the correct sequence.

### 10. What is the significance of timing in computer operations?
**Answer:** Timing in computer operations ensures that all components of the system operate in synchrony. It governs the speed at which instructions are executed and data is processed, typically managed through clock signals.
