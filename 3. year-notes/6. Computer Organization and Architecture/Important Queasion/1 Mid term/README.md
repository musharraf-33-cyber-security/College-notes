# Queasion  are................................
 
1. **Register Transfer Language (RTL)**:
   - What is it? 
   - It shows how data moves between registers.
   - Why is it important?
   - It helps us understand how computers work.
2. **Bus and Memory Transfers**:
   - What is a bus?
   - It’s like a road for data to travel.
   - How does it work?
   - It connects different parts of the computer.
3. **Micro-Operations**:
   - What are they?
   - Basic tasks the computer does with data.
   - Can you name some types?
   - Arithmetic, Logic, and Shift micro-operations.
4. **Arithmetic Micro-Operations**:
   - What do they do?
   - They perform math like adding or subtracting.
5. **Logic Micro-Operations**:
   - What do these do?
   - They make decisions using AND, OR, and NOT.
6. **Shift Micro-Operations**:
   - What happens here?
   - They move data left or right in a register.
7. **Arithmetic Logic Shift Unit (ALU)**:
   - What is it?
   - It does math and logic.
   - Why is it important?
   - It helps the CPU make calculations!

Now, about Basic Computer Organization and Design:
1. **Instruction Codes**:
   - What are these?
   - They tell the computer what to do.
2. **Computer Registers**:
   - What are they?
   - Small storage places in the CPU.
3. **Computer Instructions**:
   - What do they do?
   - They are specific tasks like "add" or "move."
4. **Timing and Control**:
   - Why is timing important?
   - It makes sure everything happens in order.
5. **Instruction Cycle**:
   - What is it?
   - The process of fetching, decoding, and executing instructions.
6. **Register-Reference and Memory-Reference Instructions**:
   - What’s the difference?
   - One uses registers, the other uses memory.
7. **Input-Output and Interrupt**:
   - What do these do?
   - They help the computer communicate with other devices.
8. **Design of Basic Computer**:
   - Why is design important?
   - It decides how well the computer performs.
